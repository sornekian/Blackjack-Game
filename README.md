# Blackjack-Game

This is my rendition of a Blackjack card game. To start the game simply click on the Start button and proceed to click on an amount to bet with. Continue to either click on Hit or Stay if you want to see the Dealers hand. When the game ends, a message will be displayed conveying the winner of that round. To play again, click on Reset and continue to Bet then Hit or Stay.
